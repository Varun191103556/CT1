A positive number is called as Armstrong of order n if abc=a^n+b^n+c^n. The number is called an Armstrong number if the sum of the cubes of each digit is equal to the number itself.

For Example:

153 is an Armstrong number because of 1*1*1+5*5*5+3*3*3=153 which is equal to the number itself. Now we will take another example of 1253 =1*1*1+2*2*2+5*5*5+3*3*3=1253 which is equal to number i.e 1253.

Armstrong Number Algorithm:

1st Step: Take an Integer value from the user.

2nd Step: Now assign that value to the variable.

3rd Step: Now split all the digits.

4th Step: Find the cube value of each digit.

5th Step: Add all the value of the cubes.

6th Step: now store that value in a variable.

7th Step: if the value of addition is equal to input number then print Armstrong.

8th Step: else print Not an Armstrong number.

There are so many methods to check whether the number is Armstrong or not we will see the methods one by one.
